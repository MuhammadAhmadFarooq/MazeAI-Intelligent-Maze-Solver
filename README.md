# MazeAI-Intelligent-Maze-Solver
Technologies: Python, AI Algorithms, Machine Learning, Visualization 
- - - 
Engineered a smart maze-solving system using classical AI methods: BFS, DFS, A*, Greedy Best-First Search, and CSP with 
Backtracking. 
Trained a model on 100K+ mazes to predict the optimal solving algorithm based on maze structure. 
Added real-time visualizations and performance metrics to compare algorithm efficiency.
